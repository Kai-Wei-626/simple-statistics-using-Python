"""Q1
  A survey of National Federation of Independence Business (NFIB) indicates that small businesses intended to increase their hiring 
  as well as their capital expenditures during 1986 as compared with 1985. Suppose that, as part of a follow-up survey by NFIB, 
  20 small businesses, randomly chosen from the NFIB's list of 2,100 companies, show an average hiring from 1985 equal to
  3.2 new employees per firm and a standard deviation of 1.5 hires. A random sample of 30 small businesses taken at the end of 1986 
  shows an average of 5.1 new hires and a standard deviation of 2.3 hires. At the Î± = 0.01
  level of significance, can you conclude that average hiring by all small businesses in 1986 increased as compared with 1985?

It is known that the average stay of tourists in Hong Kong hotels has been 3.4 nights.

General Motors Corporation hopes to reduce anticipated production costs of its Saturn Model by 
instituting an assembly schedule that will reduce average production time to about 40 hours per car. 
In a test run of the new assembly line, 40 cars are built at a sample average time per car of 46.5 hours 
and a sample standard deviation of 8.0 hours. A test run of 38 cars using the old assembly schedule results 
in a sample of mean of 51.2 hours and a sample deviation of 9.5 hours. Is there proof that the new assembly 
schedule reduces the average production time per car? What is the p-value? Explain.
